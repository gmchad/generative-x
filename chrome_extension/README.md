# Chrome Extension

Why: parse the content of selected pages, as other approaches (official/unofficial APIs do not seem to work).

This extension can be activated by clicking on the icon in the toolbar, and then selecting the kind of page to parse.

## Installation

1. Download this repo - the extension is in the `chrome_extensions/src` folder (where this file is)
2. Open Chrome > Go to Extensions
3. Enable Developer mode (switch top-right)
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `src` folder at the same level of this file

## Usage

1. Browse to https://twitter.com
2. Click on the extension icon in the toolbar (heart-shaped for now)
3. Select "X Timeline" from the menu
